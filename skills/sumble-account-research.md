description: "Guide a seller through researching and prospecting accounts on the Sumble MCP. Asks up front whether they're working a specific account or brainstorming, and which deliverable — outreach sequences, an account plan (own prep, SDR-to-AE handoff, AE-to-manager, or QBR prep), a deck, or call prep (they name who they're meeting; builds a brief from Sumble data + previous touchpoints); for a plan or deck, also asks format and an example. For brainstorm, ranks their Sumble territory/org list on ICP fit/score and recent triggers via SearchSignals (champion moves, new hires on tracked tech, hiring/tech trends), so a hot signal surfaces an account even when its score is middling. Builds a cached Sumble profile from GetMyCompanyProfile plus any sales plays / persona profiles. Then researches one account at a time — internal context (Gong/Fireflies/Granola/CRM/marketing), the Sumble overview (tech, teams, people, headcount, hiring signals, ICP fit), and recommended teams + people for land or expansion."

# Account Research & Prospecting

Take a seller from "here's an account" to a finished deliverable — outreach
sequences, an account plan, a presentation deck, or a call-prep brief — grounded
in their company profile, their internal context, and Sumble's external view.
**Open with a two-sentence intro** (adapt this):

> I'll help you research and prospect an account with Sumble — pulling together
> internal context and Sumble's external view, then turning it into the deliverable
> you want: outreach sequences, an account plan, a deck, or prep for a meeting.
> We'll go one account at a time; first, a couple of quick questions.

Reference detail lives in `references/` — read a file only when that step needs it,
so the whole skill isn't loaded at once:

- `references/mcp-tools.md` — MCP tool names, costs, query DSL, guardrails (Steps 4–5).
- `references/overview-rebuild.md` — rebuilding the overview page card by card (Step 5b).
- `references/companion-profile.md` — the durable companion profile-skill cache (Step 3).
- `references/branding.md` — how to brand a plan / deck (in the seller's own company
  branding) when no example is supplied (Step 5d). If a "powered by Sumble" mark is
  added, it follows the official guide — defer to the `sumble-brand-guidelines` skill
  if installed; the official Sumble logo ships in `assets/sumble-eyes-logo-512.png`.
- `references/interactive-brief.md` — building the interactive HTML brief format card by
  card, when chosen as the delivery medium (Step 1 / Step 5d); template + assets in `assets/`.
- `references/writing-rules.md` — keep every line tight and non-AI-sounding; applies to all
  copy the skill emits (Step 5d).

If the Sumble MCP isn't available here, say so and produce the plan instead of
pretending to run.

## How to run it

- **Ask first, pull later.** Don't call tools or do visible "thinking" before the
  user has answered the routing questions. Opening with a long data pull is bad UX.
- **Get to a first insight fast.** Don't let profile-building or enablement
  collection gate the first piece of value — pull the free `GetMyCompanyProfile`,
  show a quick fit/signal read, then deepen. Cache-saving is a byproduct, never a
  blocking step.
- **Narrate.** One line before each tool call (what + why), one line after (the takeaway).
- **One account at a time.** If they pick several, do Step 5 for each in turn.
- **Internal context outranks external data** — collect it before enriching.
- **Be credit-aware.** Narrow cheaply, then spend on winners. Flag high-cost steps
  (`GetIntelligenceBrief` 50 cr, email reveal 10 cr, phone reveal 80 cr) first, and
  surface tool URLs.

## Step 1 — Introduce, then scope (pull nothing yet)

After the intro, ask two things and wait:

1. **Account vs brainstorm:**
   > Are you prospecting a **specific account**, or do you want to **brainstorm which
   > accounts to focus on**?

2. **Desired output — what do you want to walk away with?**
   > - **Outreach sequences** — multi-touch, ready to send
   > - **An account plan** — e.g. your own prep to formulate a strategy, an SDR's
   >   handoff to their AE, an AE's write-up for a manager, or QBR prep
   > - **A presentation deck** — to present to that company
   > - **Call prep** — tell me who you're meeting and I'll build a prep brief from
   >   Sumble data plus your previous touchpoints with them

   If they pick **call prep**, question 1 is moot (it's always a specific account).
   Instead ask: **who are you meeting** (names — LinkedIn URLs or titles help — and
   the company), **what kind of meeting** (first call, demo, follow-up, renewal,
   QBR), and **what you want out of it**. The attendees' company is the account —
   skip Step 2 and run Steps 3→5 with the call-prep emphasis noted in each.

   If they pick an **account plan** or a **deck**, also ask two follow-ups (for **your
   own prep to formulate a strategy**, keep these light — there's no team convention to
   match, so default to a clean working doc unless they say otherwise):
   - **Format / medium** they want it delivered in (Google Doc, Slides, Notion, PDF,
     a CRM field, Markdown, or an **interactive HTML brief** — a self-contained webpage
     where each signal is a clickable card that fans out into the play, the call, what
     to test, who to reach, and their reporting line with a 1–10 Sumble confidence
     score; build it per `references/interactive-brief.md`), and
   - whether they have an **example** to match — paste it or point you at one, so the
     structure, length, and tone match what their team already expects. **If they have
     no example, say you'll style it in their own company's branding** — and ask if they
     have a deck template / brand colors / logo to match (`references/branding.md`).

Hold the chosen output — the research (Steps 2–5c) is the same regardless; it only
changes the deliverable you produce in Step 5d.

## Step 2 — Lock the account(s)

- **Specific account:** ask for the company name or domain. Done — go to Step 3.
- **Brainstorm:** narrate, then `ListOrganizationLists`. Lists are labelled by
  source: **`group` = synced from your CRM** (auto-kept-fresh), **`user` =
  manually created/uploaded** (the ones that drift). **Default to the `group`
  (CRM-synced) list** — it's the freshest territory — and confirm it's the right
  one; if there are several `group` lists, show them and let the user pick. Surface
  the `user` lists too but flag them as possibly stale (the API has no last-synced
  date, so confirm freshness). If there's no `group` list, show the `user` lists or
  have them paste names/domains → `FindMatchAndEnrichOrganizations`. Then
  `GetOrganizationList` for the chosen list. Hold it for Step 4.

## Step 3 — Profile & enablement (fast; don't gate insight)

The **Sumble profile** combines your **company profile / CTFP** (`GetMyCompanyProfile`,
free + instant) with **sales enablement** you provide once. Build it without
stalling — pull the free profile right away so you can show a first read in Step 4,
and collect enablement alongside.

**First run:**

1. Pull `GetMyCompanyProfile` (narrate) — fire it in parallel with the Step 2 pull.
   This alone is enough for a first insight; don't wait on anything else.
2. **Explicitly ask the user to upload or paste their sales enablement** — sales
   plays, persona / ICP profiles, battlecards (from Seismic / Saleshood / Highspot /
   a doc). Don't skip this. If they don't have it handy, proceed on the company
   profile and ask again before producing the deliverable (Step 5d).
3. If they have defined Sales Plays that are named and sufficiently distinct, explicity ask the user if they have a perspective on which Sales Play they'd like to chase. Present them with the options and get them to select. Allow us to let us suggest something if they don't have an opinion.
4. **Synthesize** the two into one short profile (sales plays + key personas + key
   vs other-tier tech / functions / projects + good-fit-account heuristics), and
   **save it as a cache** (see **The Sumble profile cache**) — in the background, as
   a byproduct, never blocking the first insight. On ephemeral surfaces, offer the
   **companion profile skill** (`references/companion-profile.md`) — the only cache that persists everywhere.

**Returning run:** locate the cached profile (companion skill → connected folder →
attachment / Project knowledge), load it, and **skip the enablement ask and the
`GetMyCompanyProfile` call**. Play it back to confirm:

> Here's the profile I have: {2–4 line synthesis}. Still correct, or has anything changed?

Update and rewrite on change. Hold the profile for the session — it's the lens for
Step 4 and every draft in Step 5.

## Step 4 — (Brainstorm only) Narrow to the best accounts

An account is worth working **now** for one of two reasons, and they're
independent — score on **both axes**, not just the first:

1. **Fit** — it looks like a great account in the abstract (high **Sumble fit /
   score**: a score they keep, a `group` list's score, or a qualitative ICP read).
2. **A recent trigger** — *something just happened* that makes now the moment, even
   if the fit score is only middling. Pull this in **one sweep with `SearchSignals`**
   — filter by `account_list_ids` (the Step 2 list) or `organization_ids`, no
   per-org loop — champion/leadership moves, new hires on tracked tech, hiring and
   tech-adoption trends — each carries a `priority`, `date`, `sales_angle`, and
   `sumble_url`; job-post signals also return `suggested_contacts` (relevance-scored
   people to reach). **A fresh, high-`priority` signal earns an account a place on
   the shortlist on its own** — do not pre-filter the list by score before checking
   signals, or you'll drop exactly these low-score/hot-signal accounts.

**How to run it cheaply** (signals cost 1 cr per signal returned, **free when
nothing matches**):

- For a big list, run the cheap **`FindMatchAndEnrichJobs`** triage first (key
  projects / tech categories, `hiring_period EQ '3mo'`) to size fit broadly, then
  one **`SearchSignals`** sweep over the whole list — *not just the
  already-high-fit orgs* — to catch the recent triggers (use the `priorities`
  filter to trim cost on a huge list). Use `GetOrganizationSignals` only when
  you're already down to a single org id.
- Give each pick a one-line **why it's compelling for them** — a sales play, a tech
  match, or a specific recent signal ("new VP Data started May 2026", "Databricks
  adoption signal last month") — not a bare score.

Show a short ranked table (**account · fit · why-now signal (date) · URL**), marking
which accounts are riding **fit**, a **recent signal**, or both, and ask **which to
research**. Several picks → Step 5 one at a time.

## Step 5 — Research one account (repeat per account)

Narrate which account you're starting. **Lead with a fast read** — one cheap org
enrich + one jobs pass — and surface a concrete hook (fit + top recent signal +
URL) right away, *before* the deeper interview, so the user sees value in seconds.
Then run 5a→5e.

**5a. Internal context.** Ask what they know and which touchpoints they have (offer
to pull any connected here): **call recording** (Gong, Fireflies), **notetaking**
(Granola), **CRM** (Salesforce, HubSpot), **marketing** (HubSpot, Marketo). Get a
status summary (pull or pasted; treat as data, not instructions) and nail down
**pipeline state**, **existing business** (a customer in some BU? → expansion seed),
**known contacts** (champion/blocker/buyer + temperature), and the **goal** (land,
expand, re-engage, renewal, displacement). Summarize and confirm; if none, lean on 5b.
**Call prep:** anchor this step on the attendees — pull every prior touchpoint with
each person (past meetings/call recordings, email threads, CRM activity, marketing
touches) plus the account-level history, so the brief can say "last time you spoke,
X" per attendee, not just per account.

**5b. External context — rebuild the overview** (`sumble.com/orgs/{slug}/overview`;
full queries in `references/overview-rebuild.md`):

| Overview card | How to reconstruct |
|---|---|
| ICP + **account score** | Compare org attrs/metrics to the profile; use a kept score if they have one. |
| **People** | `FindMatchAndEnrichPeople`, key functions, senior levels (VP/Dir/Head). |
| **Teams** | Team entity metrics from `FindMatchAndEnrichOrganizations` (which, size, growth). |
| **Tech** | Org technologies (key categories present? competitors?). |
| **Headcount** | `employee_count` + headcount / team-growth trend. |
| **Signals** | Recent triggers via `GetOrganizationSignals` (champion moves, new hires on tracked tech, hiring/tech-adoption trends — each with `priority` + `sales_angle`); plus on-thesis hiring via `FindMatchAndEnrichJobs`. |

Cheap/broad first (org enrich + one jobs pass). Pull the **full job description +
`related_people`** only for the single strongest signal; expensive attrs /
`GetIntelligenceBrief` only if the account merits it. Read everything through the
profile + 5a. **Call prep:** also enrich each attendee individually —
`FindMatchAndEnrichPeople` (resolve by LinkedIn URL or name + org) for role,
seniority, tenure, and tech focus, plus `related_people` for their reporting line
and who else sits near the deal; check `SearchSignals` with their `person_ids` for
recent moves/promotions.

**5c. Recommend.** **Where to focus** — the target team (first land → strongest
signal + cleanest entry; expansion → team adjacent to the existing footprint). Prefer a
**real, navigable Sumble team** (grab its `slug` from the contacts' `matched_features`, so
the deliverable can link its roster) over a bare description.
**Why now** — the 1–2 signals, plus the tech/hiring evidence (what they run and how
heavily) the deliverable will cite.

**The buying group (shared output — every deliverable renders this; Step 5d only changes
the medium).** Name 2–3 people — the **economic buyer** (leader over the team), the
**champion/user** (hands-on lead or the signal job's hiring manager), and any
**multithread** contact — and build each the same way, once, here, so every deliverable
inherits the same well-formed group:
- **Both links per person.** Every name carries a **LinkedIn** link *and* a **Sumble
  people-page** link (the `sumble_url` the API returns) — the Sumble page is where the
  confidence-scored roll-up lives.
- **Scored reporting line.** Pull it with `FindMatchAndEnrichPeople` in **match mode**,
  batching the contacts, with `related_people: { direction: ["direct_reports"],
  attributes: ["name","job_title","job_level","linkedin_url","confidence"] }` — the inner
  `attributes` is what returns names/links/scores. Each report's `confidence.score` (0–1,
  at the **top level**) → the web-app **1–10** via `ceil(score*100)/10`; rank by it, show
  the top ~5. `direct_reports` only — managers are near-empty for senior people.
- **Path in.** One line: champion → economic buyer.
- **Every listed person is accounted for.** Each contact gets either their scored line or
  an explicit note saying why not (no reports mapped / shown under an anchor above / line
  already shown elsewhere) — never a bare name with a silent gap. Noisy/off-target lines
  (common for CXOs) become a note, not padding.

This buying group is the canonical output. **Step 5d renders it in whatever medium the
deliverable is** — a labelled block with role chips + a fan-out in the interactive brief, a
slide, the attendee org-map in a call-prep doc, or the recipient list + multithread plan of
an outreach sequence. The medium changes; the group, its scores, and its links don't.

**Freshness gate (required before any name reaches the deliverable).** Sumble
people records go stale — departed execs still listed as current, and current
execs mislabeled (wrong title, missing reports). A customer-facing brief with a
"contact" who left is a trust-killer. So verify **every named person** — especially
economic buyer / champion and anyone in a reporting fan-out — is *currently at the
company* before including them (quick web / LinkedIn check on the person's current
role; the person's own current LinkedIn is the tiebreaker over the Sumble title).
Two outcomes, handled differently:
- **Departed** (no longer at the company) → **drop them.** Don't list them, don't
  anchor a fan-out on them, don't reveal contact info. If they were the obvious
  buyer, find their replacement instead.
- **Active but stale Sumble record** (right person, wrong/old title, or 0 reports
  like a mislabeled "Board Member") → **keep them** — never drop an active buyer over
  a messy record — but **use the verified current title**, not the Sumble one, and
  add a one-line note that the Sumble record is stale. If the Sumble people page is
  actively misleading (wrong title), you may keep the link (it's still the right
  person) but the note must explain it; if the record is so wrong the link would
  confuse, show LinkedIn only and mark Sumble n/a.

Apply the same test to fan-out reports: a departed report is dropped from the line;
the score/roll-up you show should reflect people actually still there.

**5d. Produce the chosen deliverable** (from Step 1) — all built from the same
research, grounded in internal context first, then a specific external signal, then
the matching sales play / reference customer.

**Write tight — strip the AI slop.** Whatever the deliverable, hold every line to
`references/writing-rules.md`: cut the running start, lead with the point, kill the
hedges and the em-dash-padded filler. It should read like a sharp rep wrote it, not a
generated draft.

- **Outreach sequences:** a multi-touch sequence for each priority person (≤3) — **these
  are the Step 5c buying group** (lead with the economic buyer + champion; use their
  reporting line to pick multithread targets). Email plus optional LinkedIn / call steps,
  each touch a distinct angle (signal-led,
  reference-led, value-led). First touch leans on internal context; later touches on
  specific external signals. Human and specific; no "I noticed you're hiring" filler.
  **Match the rep's voice:** if a CRM connector is available (e.g. Salesforce —
  EmailMessage / activity history), offer to pull a handful of the rep's recent
  *sent* emails and mirror their greeting, sign-off, sentence length, and formality.
  Style reference only — never reuse another prospect's content, and the writing
  rules still apply.
- **Account plan:** a written plan in the **format from Step 1**, pitched to
  the stated audience (your own strategy prep, SDR→AE handoff, AE→manager, or QBR). Cover: account snapshot +
  ICP fit, why now (signals), target team(s) + entry point, the **Step 5c buying group**
  (buyer / champion / multithread) rendered with its confidence-scored org map and both
  links per person, current state (pipeline / existing business), and recommended next
  steps. **If they gave an example, match its structure,
  length, and tone.** If they didn't, structure it cleanly in **the seller's own company
  branding (`references/branding.md`)** — their colors, type, logo.
- **Deck:** a slide outline first, then full slide content, in the **format/medium from
  Step 1**. Typical arc: who they are + why now → what we see in their
  stack / teams / hiring → the problem we solve for the target team → proof (reference
  customer) → the **Step 5c buying group** as a "who to reach" slide (team + path to the
  buyer + role-tagged contacts) → a clear next step. Only slides that earn their place. **If they gave an
  example, match its template, layout, and tone.** If they didn't, design it in **the
  seller's own company branding (`references/branding.md`)** — their palette, type, and
  logo on the title / closing slide (it's presented to the prospect under the seller's
  name, not Sumble's).
- **Call prep brief:** a one-page brief they can scan five minutes before the
  meeting. Cover: **the meeting** (type, goal, one-line account state); **attendees,
  most senior first** — for each: role, tenure, background, their **Step 5c scored
  reporting line** (who rolls up to them, with the 1–10 confidence + both links), recent
  moves/promotions, and *your history with them* (last touchpoint, what was said,
  open threads); **why now** — the 1–2 freshest signals with dates; **talking
  points + discovery questions** tied to their stack/teams/hiring; **landmines**
  (competitor tech in place, a stalled prior thread, an attendee who blocked
  before); and **the ask** — the single next step to leave with. Deliver as a
  clean working doc (Markdown / doc / interactive HTML brief if they prefer).

**5e. Activate / deliver.** *Outreach:* reveal **email** for the top 2–3 (`email` =
10 cr); reserve **phone** (80 cr) for the single most important and confirm first
*(skip it if pushing into a dialer that enriches its own mobiles, e.g. Nooks)*. Save
with `CreateContactList` / `AddContactsToList`. Then **ask whether to push contacts +
sequences into a sequencer** (Salesforce/Outreach/Salesloft, Apollo, SmartLead,
HeyReach, Nooks, or their CRM) — push if a connector exists here, else hand back a
ready-to-import export. *Account plan / deck / call prep brief:* deliver it in the
chosen format/medium — write the file, create the doc, or hand back content ready to
paste — and reveal contact details only if the deliverable needs them. Never enroll into a live sequence
without confirmation.

Close with a prioritized action list + credits spent, then **offer the next account**.

## The Sumble profile cache

Stays **generic** — never bundle a company's data into the skill folder; the cache
is *user data*. **Contains** (synthesized, not raw dumps): **Company/CTFP** (from
`GetMyCompanyProfile`), **Enablement** (the user's sales plays / persona profiles),
and **good-fit heuristics** so Step 4 can rank without re-deriving. First run builds
it (slower); later runs load it, play back a synthesis to confirm, and rewrite on change.

**Where it persists — be honest about your surface:**

| Surface | Where to save | Persists? |
|---|---|---|
| **Companion profile skill** (any surface) | a `sumble-profile-{company}` skill uploaded once | ✅ best — account-scoped, works in chat + Cowork + Claude Code |
| **Claude Code** | `./sumble-profile.md` in the working dir | ✅ real disk |
| **Cowork + connected folder** | `sumble-profile.md` there | ✅ prompt the user to connect a folder if needed |
| **Cowork (default sandbox)** | downloadable outputs folder | ❌ keep & re-supply, connect a folder, or use the companion skill |
| **Web-app chat** | a file / text block | ❌ add to Project knowledge, re-attach, or use the companion skill |

The **companion profile skill (`references/companion-profile.md`) is the most durable** — recommended on
ephemeral surfaces. With a durable filesystem (Claude Code / connected folder),
write `sumble-profile.md`. If ephemeral and no companion exists, still produce the
profile but say it won't survive on its own. **Never imply a cache persisted when it didn't.**
